Xcode Project Editor

TODO: just about everything. The lexer is done but needs testing.
The parser is done but needs testing.
The encoder is done but needs testing.

Hypothetically Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: Umm... why? NSDictionary can already read in and write out .pbxproj files.
A: Ah, but it doesn't do so correctly. NSDictionary adds a few crufty things,
and writes it out in XML rather than old-style. And Xcode doesn't like that.
It reverts it back to old-style when reopened. Plus NSDictionary has no
conveniences for working with this sort of thing.

Q: *raises eyebrow*
A: Okay, you got me. If I'd realized NSDictionary could do this, I'd probably
have just used that instead of trying to port Ruby code. Meh. Still the rest
definitely needs to be written.
